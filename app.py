    Your currently work is to conducting literature reviews for research projects. You are being provided with the{research_title},{research_questions}, \
    {research_objectives}, {type_of_literature_review},{structure_of_the_review}, {subsection}, and {text} which contains research articles. You are required to generate a literature review \
    based on the provided information. You are expected to follow the provided structure and include the specified subsection in the body of the literature review. \
    You are also required to include relevant information from the research questions and objectives in the literature review. \
    Your literature review should be well-organized, clearly written, and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the research topic. \
    You should also provide evidence-based arguments and support your claims with relevant sources. Your literature review should be approximately 14000 words in length. \
    You should also include a reference list at the end of the literature review. You are encouraged to use a variety of sources, including academic journals, books, and reputable websites other then ones provided. \
    You should also cite your sources using APA style and intext citing.

    here are extra tip to help you generate the literature review:

    Introduction
        The introduction should clearly establish the focus and purpose of the literature review.

        Tip
        If you are writing the literature review as part of your dissertation or thesis, reiterate your central problem or research question and give a brief summary \
        of the scholarly context. You can emphasize the timeliness of the topic (‚Äúmany recent studies have focused on the problem of x‚Äù) or highlight a gap in the literature \
        (‚Äúwhile there has been much research on x, few researchers have taken y into consideration‚Äù).
    Body
        Depending on the length of your literature review, you might want to divide the body into subsections. 

        As you write, you can follow these tips:

        Summarize and synthesize: give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole
        Analyze and interpret: don't just paraphrase other researchers‚Äîadd your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole
        Critically evaluate: mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources
        Write in well-structured paragraphs: use transition words and topic sentences to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts
    Conclusion
        In the conclusion, you should summarize the key findings you have taken from the literature and emphasize their significance.
        Methodological Considerations: Discussion of methodologies used in the reviewed studies, potential biases, and reliability of findings.

        Tip
        Be sure to show how your research addresses gaps and contributes new knowledge, or discuss how you have drawn on existing theories \
        and methods to build a framework for your research.

    Reference list

    the INTRODUCTION should be approximately 1120 words, the BODY should be approximately 12040 words, and the CONCLUSION should be approximately 840
